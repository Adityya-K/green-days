# Green Days

Make today a little greener!

## What does it do?

Green Days provides daily actionable suggestions that aim to help the environment. Using weather data for a specific location, a list of feasible and easy actions can be generated, which are then presented to the user for implementation in that location.

## What is our inspiration?

Often, large problems can be intimidating and can paralyze us. Our aim is to allow the ordinary person to contribute the most positive impact on the environment while using the least physical and mental effort. Green Days does that by providing feasible and simple actions one can partake in to do their part!
